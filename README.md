_Note: You'll need your own OpenAI API key to use the live demo._

## üéØ Project Overview

This system automatically audits travel bookings against three key compliance rules:

1. **Flight Ticket Timing** - Ensures departure and arrival times fall within approved travel periods
2. **Passenger Identity** - Validates passenger name consistency between approvals and reservations
3. **Route Compliance** - Checks prefered airline's routes from json database

### Application Flow Diagram

The system follows a clear sequential flow from API key validation through compliance checking to report generation, with proper error handling at each stage.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **AI Model**: OpenAI reasoning models - Complex compliance rule interpretation
- **AI Framework**: LangChain - Mature ecosystem for simplified LLM integration and prompt management
- **Backend**: Python 3.9+ - Native AI/ML ecosystem enabling rapid prototyping and maintainable code
- **UI**: Streamlit - Rapid web development with rich UI components and seamless Python integration
- **Testing**: Pytest - Standard testing framework with comprehensive coverage
- **Environment**: python-dotenv - Secure environment variable management

## üñ•Ô∏è Work Examples

The application provides an intuitive web interface for compliance auditing:

## üîÆ Possible Future Improvements

The following improvements are planned to enhance the system's capabilities and production readiness:

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Infrastructure

- **Frontend Migration to React** - Transition from Streamlit to React-based frontend for improved state management, enhanced user experience, and better scalability
- **Serverless Architecture** - Refactor to serverless deployment with automated alert mechanisms for cost-effective, event-driven processing
- **Retry Mechanisms** - Implement robust retry logic with exponential backoff for improved reliability and fault tolerance across all external API calls

### ü§ñ AI & Model Enhancements

- **Improve Model Support** - Integrate additional AI model providers (Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, DeepSeek or Grok) for enhanced flexibility and cost comparison
- **Dynamic Schema Understanding** - Enable agents to dynamically parse and understand JSON field structures through integrated API documentation uploads
- **LLM Monitoring & Observability** - Implement comprehensive monitoring for model performance, token usage, response quality, and error tracking

### üìä Data & Integration

- **Real-time Data Fetching** - Replace static JSON databases with live API integrations for airline routes, approval workflows, and ticket reservations
- **Cost Tracking & Analytics** - Implement detailed cost monitoring for API usage, processing time, and operational expenses with automated reporting

### üîß Operations & Monitoring

- **Performance Metrics** - Add comprehensive dashboards for system health, processing times, and compliance audit success rates
- **Automated Alerting** - Configure intelligent notification systems for compliance violations, system errors, and operational anomalies
