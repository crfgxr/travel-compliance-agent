# Travel Compliance Agent Case Study

We would like you to design and present an AI agent-based automation solution that will automatically audit the following rules.

‚úàÔ∏è Scenario Summary

| Control Header       | Detail                                          | Expected Compliance                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Flight Ticket Timing | Departure ‚Üí takeoff time, Return ‚Üí landing time | Reservation must fall within travel start-end range |
| Passenger Identity   | Employee-Guest name surname matching            | Must be consistent across all reservations          |
| Route Compliance     | Different airline used on "SunExpress" route?   | If yes: when, where, how? report it                 |

üöÄ Delivery Expectations

**Solution Design**

- Brief architecture/pseudo-code or flow diagram
- Selected technology stack and rationale

**Implementation (MVP sufficient)**

- Working code that evaluates the rules
- JSON input-output examples

**Test Suite**

- Positive (PASS) and negative (FAIL) scenarios
- Brief test report or unit tests

**Documentation**

- "How it works, how to install" README
- Design assumptions & improvement suggestions

**Attachments**

You can use Ticket.json and TravelApproval.json files as reference data. This is not real production data, feel free to experiment with it.

## Timeline

- Task submission: This email + attachments (T 0)
- Delivery: Within T + 96 hours (zip or repo link / Working demo environment)
- Live presentation/Q&A: Following business day 30 min MS Teams (calendar invitation will follow separately)

## Small Tips

- You are free to choose the coding language; just don't put the reader into turbulence.
- Additional rule suggestions or flexibility margins are bonus points.
